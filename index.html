<h1 class="title is-1">MaratonIME Winter School</h1>

<p>
The MaratonIME ICPC Winter School 2017 is organized by
<a href="http://www.ime.usp.br/~maratona" target="_blank">MaratonIME</a>
and hosted by
<a href="http://www.ime.usp.br/" target="_blank">IME-USP</a>
during two weeks from
<strong>July 10th</strong> to <strong>July 21st</strong>.
Our main goal is to train
<a href="https://icpc.baylor.edu/" target="_blank">ICPC</a>
contestants from all over the world for the national
regionals and the World Finals.
<p>

<p>
There will be two former World Finalists as instructors, one for each week.
We expect to receive students from other countries, specially from Texas A&M.
Also, one instructor is from Slovakia so all the activities will be held in <strong>English</strong>.
</p>

<p>
All interested students must register individually through the
<a href="/registration">registration page</a>.
If you have a team, all three members must register individually. There is no fee, but we will
<strong>not</strong> provide any kind of food, housing or transportation.
</p>

<p>
We will <a href="#">live stream</a> all the lectures on YouTube. You can take part of the contests remotely.
Don't forget to like our
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/maratonIME/" target="_blank">facebook</a>
