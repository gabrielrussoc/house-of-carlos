<h1 class="title is-1">MaratonIME Winter School</h1>

<p>
The MaratonIME ICPC Winter School 2017 is organized by
<a href="http://www.ime.usp.br/~maratona" target="_blank">MaratonIME</a>
and hosted by
<a href="http://www.ime.usp.br/" target="_blank">IME-USP</a>
during two weeks from
<strong>July 10th</strong> to <strong>July 21st</strong>.
Our main goal is to train
<a href="https://icpc.baylor.edu/" target="_blank">ICPC</a>
contestants from all over the world for the national
regionals and the World Finals.
<p>

<p>
There will be two former World Finalists as instructors, one for each week.
We expect to receive students from other countries, specially from Texas A&M.
Also, one instructor is from Slovakia so all the activities will be held in <strong>English</strong>.
</p>

<p>
All interested students must register individually through the
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/registration">registration page</a>.
If you have a team, all three members must register individually. There is no fee, but we will
<strong>not</strong> provide any kind of food, housing or transportation.
</p>

<p>
We are studying the possibility of live streaming the classes. You can take part in the contests on the second week remotely, we are still looking into the contests on the first week.
